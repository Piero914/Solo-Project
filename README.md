# Solo-Project

This is my first solo project in Codesmith. Wish me luck!

Goals and Objectives: Develop an avatar creator where the user can make a avatar and get the jpeg/png file back so they can use it as they please.

My initial idea:

- Let's make a working sign in page that users can utilize. It will have a small box in upper right corner with the png of blank face.

- Once they create an account they are asked to sign in . If they sign in, they are brough to the creation page.

- This is where the magic happens. The user will see a blank head. They will modify the head with the following fields:

1. Skin color (MAYBE)
2. Hair Style
3. Eyebrows
4. Eyebrow color
5. Eye shape
6. Eye color
7. Nose
8. Mouth
9. Facial hair (stretch goals) (Let's be real. There are going to be a lot of stretch goals. I have less than 2 days to get this done.)

We will need to store many png assets and definitely work on our HTML and CSS.

Maybe several buttons to toggle through the options that we have in database. They can trigger a toggle of

APP-
-----Main Container
-Head
-All of the attributes of the character.

Challenges coming:
getting the create account and log-in to work
structuring the express component
getting all these pngs and sizing them appropriately using CSS?
getting the button to work with the POST requests
getting the avatar to generally not look insane
being able to screenshot maybe the container and return it so the user can download it for their use
